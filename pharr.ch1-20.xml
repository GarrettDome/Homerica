THOMAS DAY SEYMOUR

PROFOUND SCHOLAR
SYMPATHETIC AND INSPIRING TEACHER
LOVER OF HOMER
AND OF ALL THINGS TRUE AND

BEAUTIFUL
<pb/>PREFACE</p>

<p>This book, now offered to the public, is the fruit of seven years
of experimentation and of much counsel with those interested in
the plan which it embodies.</p>

<p>It has already gone through four mimeographed editions, and
has been used for several years: in Ohio Wesleyan University,
in Oberlin College, and in Southwestern Presbyterian University.
In all these cases it has had marked success in creating and sustaining
interest in beginning Greek, where the crux of the whole
problem of the future of Hellenic studies lies.</p>

<p>The reasons which have conyinced the author of the necessity
for basing the work of beginners on Homeric instead of on Attic
Greek will be found in a paper, entitled “A Year—or more —
of Greek,” published in the Classical Journal for February, 1918,
and in a second paper, “Homer and the Study of Greek,” which
is printed in this book, following the table of contents. To all
who may be interested in the subject, from the standpoint of
humanistic studies, the author would heartily commend the reading
of Andrew Lang’s delightful little essay, “Homer and the Study
of Greek,” published in his collection of Essays in Little.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be hoped that a book of this kind, which seeks to
establish a new path to our common goal, will be so free from minor
errors as would one along the old established lines. Hence the
author will be profoundly grateful to those who will be generous
enough to make suggestions looking toward the betterment of the
work as well as to those who will be kind enough to point out any
errors. Naturally, in a work of this nature, there is the constantly
recurring problem of how to reconcile most successfully effective
pedagogy and scientific accuracy of statement.</p>

<p>The book does not pretend to be a text where the advanced
Homeric scholar will find catalogued every stray Homeric form, or

v
<pb/>

supposedly Homeric form, but its first object is to teach beginners
to read Greek intelligently and with pleasure.</p>

<p>It is not intended that the ordinary student shall master all the
grammar found in this text: much of it is for reference only. But
certainly every teacher should have at least this much Homeric
grammar thoroughly at command and be overflowing with it, not,
however, to the extent of attempting to teach all of it. The prime
object of first year work, as so admirably stated by Prof. Gildersleeve,
is “a maximum of forms, a minimum of syntax, and early
acquaintance with Greek in the mass.” To gain this object, it
is necessary to read, read, read Greek.</p>

<p>In the paradigms and vocabularies, both simple and compound
forms of verbs are used to supplement each other, and a free use
of analogy is employed, as is commonly done in books of this
kind. In the verbal forms, the augment is regularly supplied when
missing. t</p>

<p>Those opposed to the employment of prose sentences in Homeric
language will find it easy to omit these; but the author is convinced
that a better grasp of Homeric forms can be secured by
their use.</p>

<p>After this book is completed successfully, any one of several
roads is open for a continuation of the Greek course:

(1) Probably the most satisfactory method is to continue for
some time with Homer, reading copious extracts from the Iliad
and Odyssey. The student is now well prepared to handle successfully
the standard school editions of these.

(2) The passage from Homer to the Attic Drama is an easy one,
and is the most satisfactory introduction to the Attic dialect.
This is the course which the author would strongly recommend, as
most likely to be of the greatest value and as having probably the
strongest appeal to the most students. Euripides furnishes the
easiest reading, and several of his plays have been published in
convenient form with vocabularies (Longmans, Green and Co.),
and with both vocabularies and notes (Macmillan and Co.). This
could be followed by any one of several possibilities, some more
drama, Plato, or the New Testament.

vi
<pb/>PREFACE

(3) Some Herodotus could now be read with not much difficulty,
and his work would admirably supplement the Homeric stories.

(4) It is quite possible to read some Plato now, using a good
edition of one of the dialogues, with vocabulary and notes, such as
that of Seymour and Dyer.

(5) Many will find a strong appeal in the Lyric Poets, which
are very easy after a fair amount of Homer and contain some of the
choicest gems in all Greek literature.

(6) Some may want to read Hesiod, who is the easiest of all
authors after Homer. His' importance has not always been
recognized, and he has been entirely too much neglected in our
colleges.

(7) The New Testament could be studied to good advantage
after Homer, and is recommended to those intending to enter the
ministry.

(8) Those who are wedded to Xenophon, who teach him with
success, and who feel that he must come early in the course, will
find Homer a much better preparation for Xenophon than Xenophon
is for Homer. There are a number of good school editions,
and students can now read rapidly considerable quantities of the
Anabasis, or of any of the other works of Xenophon.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, the teacher should of course select
the author in which he has the greatest interest and for which he
has the most enthusiasm. He will find the work not only much
easier, but more successful as well.</p>

<p>To all who have assisted, directly or indirectly, in the production
of the present book, the author would here express his sincerest
appreciation and gratitude. Lack of space prevents giving a
complete list of names, but the author feels that special mention
is due to Prof. Francis G. Allinson of Brown University, for generously
reading the whole of the manuscript and for making many
helpful suggestions; to Prof. Samuel E. Bassett of the University
of Vermont, and to Prof. Edward Fitch of Hamilton College, who
also went over the manuscript and made many valuable criticisms ;
to Prof. Walter Petersen of Bethany College, whose help on a number
of grammatical problems has been invaluable; to Miss Mabel

<pb/></p>

<p>Drennan of the Swanton, Ohio, High School, for making the whole
of the two general vocabularies; to Prof. Shirley Smith of Oberlin
College and Mr. Joseph Adameç, graduate student at Yale, for
checking up the vocabulary; to Mr. W. J. Millard, student at
Southwestern Presbyterian University, for verifying the Biblical
quotations; to Prof. Wilmot Haines Thompson of Acadia University,
for reading the manuscript, making a number of valuable suggestions,
and for much valuable assistance in reading proof; to Prof.
Leigh Alexander of Oberlin College, who has generously placed
at the disposal of the author the results of two years of experience
with the book in his classes, who has read all the proof and has
saved the book from a number of errors; to the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, for the loan of some unusually fine photographs for
illustrations; to D. C. Heath and Co., for the use of illustrations from
Webster’s Ancient History, one of their texts; to Prof. Frank E.
Robbins of the University of Michigan, and to the Classical
Journal, for permission to use Prof. Robbins’s valuable statistics
on Greek verb forms, which appeared in the Classical Journal,
15, 2; to Dr. Alice Braunlich of the Davenport High School, to
Prof. G. B. Waldrop of the Westminster School, and to Dr. D. W.
Abercrombie, recently of Worcester Academy, for help in reading
the proof; and to the J. S. Cushing Company (The Norwood
Press) for their very careful and painstaking typographical work.</p>

<p>If this book will contribute to the value and interest of the study
of beginning Greek, the author will feel that his seven years of
work upon it have not been spent in vain. The time has come
when lovers of the humanities everywhere must join hands in
the promotion of the common cause. If anything seems to be of
mutual advantage, we must first test it carefully and then hold
fast to it if we find it good. Then, to all teachers of Greek and
every true friend of humanistic studies and of culture in its best
sense, the author would say in conclusion:

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</p>

<p>In an article entitled “A Year—or more— of Greek,” contributed
to the February, 1918, number of the Classical Journal,
the author sets forth a few of the more important reasons why
the present system of teaching beginners in Greek should be
revised to meet modern conditions. The sum and substance of
the article was a plea for the abandonment of Xenophon for beginning
work, something which should have been done years ago,
and the substitution of Homer in his place. The paper embodied
the results of several years of experimentation; and the primary
reason urged for the change was based on the comparative literary
value of the two authors and their appeal to beginning students.
As we view the situation to-day, we are compelled to confess that
in the hands of the average teacher, when applied to the average
student, Xenophon and all his works are all too often found to be
tedious and dreary. This leaves out of count the exceptional
teacher, who has large and enthusiastic classes in the Anabasis
year after year, for such teachers could make any subject fascinating.
Homer on the other hand possesses those qualities which
make him especially interesting, as well as of permanent value, to
the majority of students who still take Greek.</p>

<p>In this connection the author may be permitted to quote from
the article just mentioned:1 “The reasons which make Homer
so desirable are apparent when once the question is seriously
considered. His work is homogeneous in vocabulary, in literary
style and idioms employed, and in metrical form; so that when
students once get a fair start in him, further progress becomes
easier and more accelerated. He employs all three persons, with
all modes and tenses of the verb, so that all forms that are learned

1 C. J. 13, 5.</p>

<p>XXIX
<pb/>

are used enough to be kept fresh in the students’ mind and do not
have to be learned again when they begin anything which is in
dialogue form. His vocabulary is fairly limited, enough so in
fact that it does not present any special difficulty to the beginner.
His sentences are short, simple, and clear-cut, having none of the
involved structure which makes so much of Xenophon really too
difficult for first-year work. The verse, which has been considered
a bar, is an actual help, as it is quite easily learned and is a marked
aid in memorizing considerable portions of Greek, which is important
at this stage. Furthermore, the rules of quantity are a
considerable help in simplifying and illustrating the principles of
accent. As he uses only one type of verse, and that the simplest
— the dactylic hexameter — the ordinary student usually becomes
quite adept at reading this before the end of the first year’s work.

“The prose composition for the first year’s work may be based
upon Homer, the students using Homeric forms and constructions,
without knowing of the existence of any other kind. This may be
done without the slightest fear of blunting their sense of discrimination
between poetic and prose diction and style, a sense
which cannot possibly be developed until they have had several
years’ work and have read a considerable amount of Greek in both
prose and poetry. Homer is so straightforward and simple in
what he has to say, with nothing obscure, mystical, or far-fetched
in any way, that he is quite intelligible to the average high-school
freshman; and at the same time he possesses the qualities of high
literary art in such a marked degree that he appeals strongly to
the oldest and most advanced members of any college class.

"Furthermore, Homer is the best possible preparation for all
later Greek literature, much of which is unintelligible without
a fair knowledge of him. He was to Greek literature what the
Bible has been to English, and a great deal more as well. He leads
us somewhere, not merely into a blind alley as does Xenophon,
both with reference to later Greek literature and to much of the
best in later European literature as well, where his influence has
been incalculable and perhaps greater than that of any other
single writer. In him are the germs of so many things. We have

xiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

the narrative highly developed, the beginning of the drama,
oratory, statecraft, seamanship, war, adventure, and religion —
in fact, life as it was to the old Greeks in its manifold aspects.

“ Then the student who has taken only a very little of beginning
Greek, even if he has progressed no farther than the end of the
first book of the Iliad, has come into vital contact with the magic
and the music of the Greek language, used in one of the most
beautiful, one of the most varied, and one of the most influential
literary compositions of all ages; and though he may have devoted
considerable labor to mining the gold, he cannot, truthfully say,
and probably will not want to say, that Greek for him has been a
waste of time.”</p>

<p>To begin the study of Greek with Homer, it would be necessary
to substitute Homeric for Attic Greek for the work of the first year:
the student would be taught Homeric forms and constructions as a
basis for future work, and would devote to the study of Homer
the time which is now occupied by Xenophon. It is the purpose
of the present paper to develop more in detail some of the most
important reasons which make such a change not only desirable
but imperative if Greek is to be saved as a vital factor in our educational
system.</p>

<p>The idea of such a plan first suggested itself to the writer several
years ago, when, full of boundless enthusiasm for his subject
and for all things Greek, he was attempting to teach first-year
work and Xenophon, and was compelled to admit to himself that
his efforts were not meeting noth what might be called success.
Too many good students refused to take Greek in the first place,
and of those who did enlist, too many, even of the better ones, were
discouraged by the unending round of grammatical forms, leading
up to an author whose works are not of a nature to fire the imagination
and stir the hearts in the breasts of our youth, as can be,
and is, done by the great masterpieces of Hellas such as the Iliad
and the Odyssey.</p>

<p>The writer would like to make it plain that he is not a hater of
Xenophon, but that he greatly enjoyed his first year of Greek,
taken in the old way, as well as his Xenophon, later. The same

is probably true of most classical scholars. This goes a long way
toward explaining why they are now teaching Greek and Latin
instead of sociology or mechanical engineering. It would be distinctly
misleading however for those who have a special taste
for linguistic work and who enjoyed reading the production of
such authors as Caesar and Xenophon to infer therefrom that
their case is at all typical of the mass of students who take these
subjects. Although the description in Andrew Lang’s essay,
“Homer and the Study of Greek,” is probably too highly colored,
the account that he gives of his own experience and that of his
fellows in the study of beginning Greek and Xenophon ought to
have a lesson and a warning for every one who is still a friend of
the classics. He makes it quite plain that they found Xenophon
anything but inspiring, and that most of them thoroughly hated
him, an experience of many good students, which is too common
to be ignored.</p>

<p>It is only fair to state that although this idea of beginning Greek
with the reading of Homer is original with the writer, it is not
new. This was the regular method employed by the old Romans
in teaching their boys Greek, and it was highly commended by
that capable and judicious old schoolmaster, Quintilian, as the
best possible plan. Since that time it has been used now and then
by some of the world’s ablest educators and scholars. It was thus
that Joseph Scaliger (de la Scala), one of the most brilliant
names in the whole history of classical scholarship, taught himself
Greek at Paris; and many more of the great scholars of the past
learned their Greek through Homer. It was tried also by Herbart,
who began a series of experiments in Switzerland, in 1797, where he
employed this method with marked success in private tutoring.
Later he continued his experiments on a larger scale in the teachers’
training college at Koenigsberg, with such good results that he
was thoroughly convinced that this was the only suitable method
of teaching beginning Greek. At his suggestion it was tried by
Dissen, by Ferdinand Ranke, and by Hummel, all of whom were
hearty in its praise; and, most important of all, by Ahrens, at
Hanover, where it was used for thirty years (1850-1881), with

great success, but was finally abandoned because of the lack of
suitable text books and because of the opposition of other Gymnasia
which refused to adopt such a revolutionary plan. It has also
been recommended occasionally, but without success, by other
scholars and humanists, notably by Goethe, by Andrew Lang,
and by Wilamowitz, in Europe; while in America it has been
advocated in one form or another by Seymour, Bolling, Shorey,
Lane Cooper, and others. But hitherto no systematic series of
text books has been issued which are so well adapted to carry the
students through Homer and introduce them to Attic Greek as the
ones which have been worked out in connection with Xenophon.
It has become highly important that this lack be supplied, if possible,
in order that this plan, which has been tried by several
with such good success, may be tested on a wider scale, so that we
may see whether or no it will succeed in the hands of the average
teacher of beginning Greek. Thus students should be prepared
to strike immediately into the heart of Greek literature, instead
of having to go a long way around, as at present.</p>

<p>As to the superiority of Homer over Xenophon, from the standpoint
of literary values, and of interest for the average student,
there can be no quarrel. It remains for us to investigate the
relative advantages and demerits of each as mediums for teaching
the language.</p>

<p>In the first place it is essential that we disabuse our minds of the
once prevalent notion, long since exploded, but still more or less
consciously held by many, that the Attic dialect is the norm by
which all other Greek is to be judged. The language of Homer is
earlier and naturally differs from it in many essentials; therefore
it was long maintained that Homeric Greek is irregular, crude and
unfinished. Hellenistic Greek, which represents a later development
of the language, has its differences; therefore Hellenistic
Greek must be degenerate. Such an idea is utterly unscientific
and ignores completely the modern historical point of view of the
development and growth of languages. Any period which has
given birth to literary productions of surpassing merit and artistic
excellence is justified by its own works; it contains its own lin-

xvii
<pb/>HOMEEIC GKEEK

guistic standards, and will richly repay those who take the trouble
to study it. To call Homeric Greek anomalous and irregular,
because it differs in some particulars from the Attic dialect, is as
misleading as it would be to say that the language of Shakespeare
is immature and eccentric because he does not write the same type
of English as does George Ade or Stephen Leacock. As a matter
of fact, the language of the Homeric poems is quite as finished, has
quite as many virtues, and is quite as much of a norm for its
period and style of composition as Xenophon is for his; and the
different forms in Homer are no more aberrations on his part than
those of Xenophon are marks of degeneracy for him. And Attic
Greek, after all, is but one of a number of dialects, coming at neither
end but in the middle of the development of the Greek language.
It is rarely found pure in any of the great authors, and in none
which are suitable for beginners.</p>

<p>According to our present system, students are taught a smattering
of Attic Greek. Then they are given a smattering of Homer,
who represents a period several centuries earlier. Then again
comes some more Attic Greek, and if the student continues in his
work he usually gets some Doric, with sometimes a little Lesbian,
and the Ionic of Herodotus, to which is commonly added a dash
of the Koine for further confusing variety. All of this comes at
such times and at such points in his development that it is practically
impossible for the ordinary student to obtain a clear conception
of what the Greek language is like and what are the fundamental
processes of its development. As a result grammar becomes
a nightmare to be dreaded instead of an opportunity to study the
structure of one of the most interesting and instructive languages
in existence. This has reference to the linguistic features, apart
from its literary value. If on the other hand we begin with Homer
and obtain a good grounding in his language, the transition from
that to later Greek is simple and natural and in accordance with
well-established laws, so that a student who once gets a grasp
of the processes involved not only has acquired a valuable scientific
point of view, but he might be untrue enough to the traditions of
countless students of the past to find Greek grammar interesting.

xviii
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</p>

<p>Furthermore, since most of us learned our Attic Greek first,
when we came to Homeric Greek and found so many different
forms, the feeling very naturally arose with many that Homer has
many more forms than Attic Greek, and that they are more difficult.
On the contrary, the Homeric forms are not only simpler and more
transparent than the Attic and as a consequence more easily
learned — many Attic forms have to be explained hy a reference
to the Homeric ones — but the Homeric forms are considerably
fewer in number. This is best seen by a reference to the declensional
endings, as exemplified in the two tables, 479, 649.</p>

<p>From these tables we see that there are, all told, 86 Homeric
forms of the noun and adjective to be learned as against 108 Attic
forms. But this is not all. Many forms in both Attic and
Homeric Greek are so rare that it would be manifestly absurd to
compel first-year students to memorize them. For our purposes,
then, we must omit the unusually rare forms from both tables.
In the first table (479) we shall omit a number of forms which
many would include, and count only those not inclosed in brackets
which are regularly included as essential by the standard beginners’
books based on the Attic dialect. We shall not count the very
rare Homeric forms, but shall be liberal enough to include a few
which are too rare to be learned in reading Homer but are important
for students intending to read Attic Greek later. We
find then that students who' begin with Homeric Greek need to
learn only 55 forms as against 80 (88 according to some) of
the Attic. This means that it is necessary to memorize about
fifty per cent more forms in order to be able to read the first
four books of the Anabasis than it would be to read the first
six books of the Iliad. Furthermore, in the pronouns, by not
compelling the student to memorize any form which does not
occur on an average of at least once every two or three thousand
verses, there would be fewer Homeric forms to be learned here
also. The same is true of the verbs. The reflexive pronoun, for
example, and the future passive and future optative of verbs are
not found in Homer; the middle voice regularly retains the uncontracted
forms of the endingS and not in a part only as in Attic

xix
<pb/></p>

<p>Greek; and in many other ways the forms are simpler and more
easily learned. In fact many books for beginners find it easier to
teach Attic Greek by a constant reference to the earlier forms,
which in many cases are the Homeric.</p>

<p>The occasional irregular forms, which are omitted from the
ones to be learned, should be grouped in some convenient way for
reference, but need not be memorized, as they are regularly given
in their alphabetical place in the vocabulary of any good school
edition and in the ordinary lexicons. Thus the student need
not be required to memorize the five forms of the present infinitive
of ειμί, or the five forms of the genitive of iyu>, e.g., but could
learn one of each and not burden his memory with forms which
are found in every vocabulary.</p>

<p>Many Atticists have maintained that the great number of
irregularities in Homeric Greek would be an added difficulty to the
beginner. It is true that they are troublesome, but not so troublesome
as the considerably greater number of irregularities in Attic
Greek. Any one who will take the trouble to count them will
find that the irregular formations in Attic Greek considerably
outnumber those in Homer. There is not space here to catalogue
the various irregularities, heteroclites, metaplastic forms, etc., of
Attic Greek, but the lists given in Kuehner-Blass, or any other of
the more elaborate Greek grammars, are enough to convince the
most skeptical.</p>

<p>If we leave aside the irregularities and look at a few regular
formations which must be memorized, the evidence is none the less
conclusive. For example, the “regular” declensions of such words
as πόλις, βασιλεύς, νανς, τέηχνς, αστν, comparatives in -ιων, and other
forms which will readily occur to any one who has studied Attic
Greek, are so complicated that they are not ordinarily mastered by
students of beginning Greek, and it would be rather remarkable
if they were. Or let us consider a single class, such as typical
words of the third declension in νς, as πηχνς, δίπηχνς, ηόνς, ίγχελνς,
Ιχθύς. If the student learned the declension of any one of these,
and attempted to decline the rest accordingly, he would go far
astray; for of these five words, all of the third declension, and all

xx
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

ending in vs in the nominative, no two are declined alike
throughout. A comparison of the declensions of lyxcXvs (eel) with
that of Ιχθνs (fish) will illustrate the point. It seems that the old
Athenians were never able to decide definitely whether an eel
was a fish or a serpent. Accordingly, we find that they declined
lyXcXvt the first half of the way like Ιχθνs, while the other
half was different. What a pity that there are not a few more
such convenient mnemonic devices to help the student keep his
bearings on his way through the maze of Greek morphology!
If a student finally learned to decline such a word as raCs, he would
not know how to begin the declension of another word formed in
the same way, such as ypavi; nor would a student who had
learned the declension of βονς in Attic Greek know the declension
of the next word like it, χονς, and he might be led
very far astray by such a simple and common word as voCs.
All of these forms, and many more which could be cited, are highly
interesting to philologists, as they illustrate so beautifully certain
abstruse principles in Greek phonology and morphology. Unfortunately
they do not usually have the same strong appeal to
the beginner who is trying very hard to learn how to read
Greek.</p>

<p>The whole system of contraction, which is regular at times, and
the variations caused by it in the general rules- of accent and
quantity, all of which are so confusing and so difficult to the
ordinary beginner, are so little used in Homer that they can very
profitably be omitted, or else touched quite lightly, and the time
saved can be invested elsewhere to much greater advantage.</p>

<p>In the field of syntax Homer is so much simpler than Xenophon
that students ordinarily find him a great deal easier. Tlius
Homer lacks the articular infinitive; long and involved passages
in indirect discourse never occur, as well as many other strange
and foreign characteristics of Attic Greek and Xenophon, all of
which give a great deal of trouble to the ordinary beginner.</p>

<p>These elements all contribute to a quicker and an easier learning
of Greek through Homer, as has been abundantly proved by experiments
also. Thus students who begin with Homer regularly read

xxi
<pb/>

more Greek in the time devoted to him than do those who begin
with Xenophon and spend this time on the Anabasis.</p>

<p>It has long been a commonly accepted myth that Homer has
such an enormous vocabulary that students would have more
than ordinary trouble with it. In fact the vocabulary of the first
six books of the Iliad is no larger than that required for reading the
Anabasis, and one can read the whole of the Homeric poems, including
the hymns, without having to learn many more words
than to read Xenophon, and without having to learn so many
words as are necessary for the reading of Plato.</p>

<p>There are, it is true, a great number of words in Homer which are
used only once (απαξ λεγάμενα).1 The Iliad has 1097 of these,
while the Odyssey has 868, making a total of 1965. However,
this is not nearly so large as the number used by Xenophon, who
has 3021 απαξ λεγάμενα,2 of which 433 are in the Anabasis, as compared
with 266 (238 if we omit the Catalogue of Ships) in the first
six books of the Iliad.</p>

<p>It is highly important too in gaining a vocabulary to learn words
which will be used in other authors read later in the course, and to
acquire so far as possible the more fundamental meanings of words
from which their later uses are derived. Ahrens, who made a
careful study of this problem, gives the palm to Homer here without
question. According to' him, the words in Homer are much
nearer their fundamental meanings, and take on different shades of
significance in the various later authors. If one wishes to obtain
a clear grasp of Greek onomatology and semasiology, he should
begin with Homer by all means and would thus be prepared to
see more readily the later turns in the meanings of words and
phrases, which in many cases vary considerably in authors of the
same period, and sometimes even in the same author. Thus there
are over 400 words in the Anabasis which either do not occur
at all in Xenophon’s other works, or else with a different signification.
Rutherford (The New Phryn., 160 if.) says: “It did not

<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

escape the notice of later Greeks that Xenophon’s diction was very
different from that of pure Attic writers, and there are still extant
several remarks upon this point. ... A busy man, living almost
wholly abroad, devoted to country pursuits and the life of the
camp, attached to the Lacedaemonian system of government, and
detesting the Athenian, Xenophon must have lost much of the
refined Atticism with which he was conversant in his youth. It is
not only in the forms of words that he differs from Attic writers,
but he also uses many terms — the ονόματα γλωσσηματικά of
Galen — altogether unknown to Attic prose, and often assigns to
Attic words a meaning not actually attached to them in the
leading dialect.”</p>

<p>When it comes to the actual number of words of Xenophon and
Homer which enter into the vocabulary of other Greek writers,
the following tables will show their relation to some of the most
important authors read in college.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of Xenophon and Homer, which are compared
in these lists, are: Xenophon’s Anabasis entire, and Homer’s
Iliad, books I-VL The pages as given above are according to
the Teubner texts. The number of words in Xenophon’s Anabasis
is approximately the same as that of Homer’s Iliad, books I-VI.</p>

<p>In these lists, words which are closely enough related to others
that ordinary students who know the meaning of one may infer
the other are counted but once, as θάνατο·;, αθάνατοί; βαίνω, Ζκ-
βαίνω, καταβαίνω, αναβαίνω, etc. Proper names are also omitted.</p>

<p>From this table it will be seen that Homer is a much better
preparation for the Greek drama, Hesiod, the elegiac and iambic
poets, than is Xenophon, and it is along these lines that the course
should be developed. For Plato the difference is so exceedingly
slight that in the matter of vocabulary one is practically as good a
preparation as the other, and a few of his easier dialogues should
find a place after some of the best poetry has been read. After
that the Greek course ought to be able to take care of itself. Herodotus
might come at any point. There is a slight advantage here
on the side of Xenophon in the matter of vocabulary, but his
language is so much closer to that of Homer, as well as his general
style and imaginative genius, that he would be very easy and
stimulating to those who had read any considerable amount of
Homeric Greek. Those who wished to read Thucydides and the
orators would find Xenophon’s vocabulary somewhat better for
their purpose, and the same is true if they wished to read the
New Testament and Menander; but in all these the advantage
is relatively slight, and in most cases the difference would probably
not be noticeable. In the case of the New Testament, for example,
the difference is less than one word in two Teubner pages of Greek
text.</p>

<p>It is generally recognized that for the best results in the study
of the New Testament, students should read a considerable amount
of other Greek first. In the whole circle of Greek literature the
two authors most important for the student of the New Testament
are Homer and Plato. Herodotus informs us that Homer and
Hesiod were the chief sources of the Greek popular religion; and

xxiv
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

certainly one cannot obtain a clear grasp of the forces opposed to
Christianity without a good knowledge of Homer and of the hold
that Homer had upon the popular mind. If one is to read intelligently
the works of the early church fathers, he must be well
acquainted at first hand with Homer. It is Homer, Homer’s
religion, and Homer’s gods which recur constantly in their works
and which are attacked over and over again as being the bulwarks of
the heathen faith which they are striving to supplant. Homer and
the ideas he represents are infinitely more important for the student
of the New Testament and of the early church than is Xenophon;
and if one can study not more than a year or so of Greek before
taking up the New Testament, he should by all means have some
Homer followed by Plato. Experience has shown that after a
year of Homer, students can and do pass with little difficulty
into the New Testament. The passage from Homer to Attic, or
to Hellenistic, Greek is of course a great deal easier than vice versa,
and occupies very little time and effort.</p>

<p>Some have urged that since the bulk of the work in the ordinary
college course in Greek is in the Attic dialect, students who begin
with this would get a firmer grasp of it than if they began with
Homer. Some even feel that a student who did his beginning
work in Homeric forms would never be able to feel thoroughly at
home in Attic Greek. Yet few teachers would be rash enough to
suggest that because a student has had a thorough""training in
Attic Greek he is thereby disqualified from doing first-class work
in the language of the Hellenistic period, nor would many teachers
of New Testament Greek, e.g., object to a student who wished
to specialize in their subject, or even in Patristic Greek, if he came
to them with a good knowledge of Plato. Students who wish to
specialize in Pliny and Tacitus, or even in Mediaeval Latin, do
not find themselves handicapped because they did their earlier
work in such authors as Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, and
Catullus. Teachers of the Romance languages also universally
recognize that a thorough course in Latin is a prerequisite for the
highest type of scholarship in their field, and no student could
hope to do advanced linguistic work in any of these languages

xxv
<pb/>

without a thorough training in Latin. In the same way Homer
offers an unexcelled preparation not only for all later Greek literature
but for the later language as well; and instead of the present
system of confusion in the teaching of Greek grammar, particularly
with reference to the various dialects, some attempt should be
made to develop the subject in a more scientific fashion.</p>

<p>Some feel that Homer is too beautiful and too exquisite to be
used as a corpus vile for the teaching of Greek grammar. But
the very fact that he is so beautiful and so exquisite is the very
reason why he should be used at this early stage, that the students
may have an added incentive for learning their grammar, and may
not come to hate and despise the whole subject. Thus they may
see, even from the beginning, that Greek is something worth
working at, and they may have material interesting enough that
the necessary grammatical drill will not seem so much useless
drudgery.</p>

<p>A highly important consideration in placing Homer before Xenophon
in the curriculum is the fact that as matters now stand such a
large per cent of our students never reach Homer. The problem
before us with regard to these students is whether we are to give
them Xenophon or Homer. Since they represent a very large
element, not all of whom are loafers either, we owe it to ourselves
and to the cause of Greek, as well as to them, to give them that
which will be of most lasting value to them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Homer is interesting not only to older students, but
is particularly adapted to the youngest who now take Greek, as
the earliest experiments, made with boys from nine to fourteen
years of age, have amply demonstrated. He serves the double
purpose of introducing them adequately to the language and of
furnishing them with reading material as interesting as can be
found in any literature, something too of permanent value; and
he should come by all means as early as possible in the course, that
he may serve as a suitable basis for the development of those
qualities of taste and appreciation, without which the study of
all art is in vain. And after we have begun with him, we find his
treasures inexhaustible. In Herbart’s expressive phrase, “Homer

xxvi
<pb/>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK

elevates the student without depressing the teacher.” To quote
further from his lectures on education, he says (VI, 283) : “ The
reasons for giving the preference to Homer’s Odyssey in early instruction
are well known. Any one who reads the Odyssey carefully,
with an eye to the various main classes of interest which are
to be aroused by education, can discover the reasons. The point,
however, to be gained here is not merely to produce a direct effect,
but beyond that to get points of connection for progressive instruction.
There can be no better preparation for ancient history
than gaining interest for ancient Greece by the Homeric stories.
The ground is prepared for both the cultivation of taste and the
study of languages at the same time.

“Philologists will be obliged sooner or later to listen to reasons
of this kind, which are actually derived from the chief aim of all
instruction, and are only opposed by tradition (the conventional
study of Latin). This they must do, unless they desire that now,
with the growth of history and science, and the pressure of material
interests, Greek should be restricted in schools as Hebrew is at
present.

“ The Odyssey, it is true, possesses no magic power to animate
those who are entirely unsuccessful in languages, or who do not
work at them seriously; nevertheless it surpasses in definite educative
influence, as is proved by the experience of many years,
every other work of classic times that could be choserfi”</p>

<p>In conclusion the writer would earnestly suggest that it is high
time that Xenophon be omitted completely from at least the first
three years of Greek study. The time and labor now devoted to
both Xenophon and Homer should be spent on Homer alone, and
for the three books of the Iliad and the four books of the Anabasis
usually read should be substituted a course in Homer which would
be extensive enough to give the students a real insight into his
poetry, that they may learn to wander for themselves in the realms
of gold, that they may be allowed to become so familiar with his language
and his style that reading from him will be a pleasure and
not a lot of hard work to be waded through, that they may become
so filled with his spirit that they may catch a glimpse of what it

xxvii
<pb/>

means to be Homeric, and in later years, if they have gone out
into other fields and would like to turn back to Greek literature,
it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to bring out
their old book and enter again with delight into his world of song.
In the secondary schools we should have a course in Homer comprehensive
enough to enable the students to obtain a firm grounding
in his language and ideas, instead of the present smattering
of both Xenophon and Homer, neither of which the average student
knows well enough for it to serve as a stable and satisfactory basis
for future work. It would be a real step forward on the part of
the colleges, and should largely increase the number of those now
offering Greek for admission, if the requirements in Greek should
be made a requirement in Homer only, due attention being paid to
composition and grammar, of course. Thus the secondary schools
could intensify their efforts on one dialect and on one homogeneous
mass of literature, which would materially simplify their problems,
and ought to produce a much higher grade of work than is possible
at present. If colleges would admit students on one, two, and three
years, respectively, of Homer, with due credit for each, and reserve
all work in the Attic dialect for the college course proper,
the secondary teachers would have their burdens greatly lightened,
with a corresponding increase in effectiveness. In no other language
do the secondary schools undertake to prepare a student
in two separate dialects. To do so in Greek is a pedagogical
blunder which should be perpetuated no longer.
<pb/>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>The Iliad and the Odyssey, the two great Greek epics, and the
greatest of all epic poems, belong to the earliest Greek literature
that has been preserved.</p>

<p>Their action and stories are legendary and are grouped around
the incidents concerning the long siege of Troy by the Greeks, its
final capture and destruction, and the return of the Greeks home.
No attempt is made to give a systematic account of those events,
but certain leading features of the legends are developed.</p>

<p>The Iliad, has for its central theme and as the thread upon which
it strings its various events the Menis, the mad anger of Achilles,
and its dire consequences to the Greeks.</p>

<p>According to the story, Paris, son of King Priam of Troy (Ilios)
in Asia Minor, eloped with Helen, the most beautiful woman in the
world, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, in southern Greece. The
Greeks united under the command of King Agamemnon of Mycenae,
brother of Menelaus, and the most powerful of the Greek chieftains,
to avenge this wrong, capture Troy, and bring back Helen.
After ten years of preparation they gathered their forces, sailed
across the Aegean to the shores of the Hellespont (Dardanelles),
landed, and drew up their ships, out of the water, in long lines on
the shore. For ten years the siege continued before the Greeks
were able to capture the city.</p>

<p>The Iliad opens, in the ninth year of the siege, with the deadly
quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles. Before all the assembled
Greeks, Agamemnon disgraces and humiliates Achilles, and robs
him of his prize of honor which had been previously bestowed
upon him by the army. In rage and disgust, Achilles retires from

xxix
<pb/>

the conflict and sulks in his tent. As he had been their stoutest
warrior, his absence is keenly felt by the Greeks, who suffer many
defeats and heavy losses at the hands of the Trojans, now that
Achilles has withdrawn. It is only the death of his bosom friend,
Patroclus, in battle, which furnishes a motive sufficiently powerful
to induce him to take a further part in the war. To avenge his
death, Achilles enters the conflict once more, and lulls Hector,
who had slain Patroclus. Shortly thereafter he was himself killed
by an arrow shot by Paris with the help of Apollo. Finally, in the
tenth year of the siege, Troy was captured by the Greeks, by
means of the well-known stratagem of the Wooden Horse. The
city was plundered and burned; the men were killed and the women
taken as slaves. Helen was recovered ; and after many adventures
and losses by shipwreck and other misfortunes the Greeks returned
home.</p>

<p>The traditional date of the fall of Troy was 1184 b.c. The date
of the Homeric poems is not at all certain. Some think they are
as early as 850 b.c., while others would date them as late as the
latter part of the seventh century B.C. Many scholars have
thought that the poems represent a gradual growth of a long period
of time, that they were composed by a number of different bards,
and'have been worked over, edited and re-edited, till they gradually
acquired their present form. Many of these scholars would deny
that any one by the name of Homer ever lived. Others think that
Homer was one of the editors, perhaps the most important of the
editors, of the poems, that he may have composed a considerable
amount of material in them, but that his chief function consisted
in combining and working over the various lays handed down by
his predecessors. Still others are of the opinion that the whole
of the poems, or practically all of them, as we have them, were
composed outright by a single poet, who was a real historical
character, and whose name was Homer. Most are agreed that
there must have been some great, master mind, whose influence is
felt throughout the poems, but who made free use of the work
of other poets who had preceded him and who had sung of various
events connected with the same theme. As Kipling would say:</p>

<p>W’en Omer smote ’is bloomin’ lyre,
’E’d ’eard men sing by land and sea,
And wot ’e thought ’e might require,
Έ went and took, the same as me.</p>

<p>The old Greeks were practically unanimous in believing that
the poems were composed by a bard, named Homer, and
that he traveled about, in various parts of Greece, a poor,
old, blind beggar, eking out an existence by singing his poems.
After his death, we are told that: “ Seven cities claimed the</p>

<p>Homer dead, through which
the living Homer begged his
bread.” The chief contestants
for the honor of his birthplace
were Smyrna and Chios,
and the evidence of the poems
would seem to point to that
region.</p>

<p>The poems represent a very
unsettled condition of society in
the Greek world, corresponding
in many ways to the Middle
Ages in Europe. Preceding this
period, there had been a brilliant
civilization in the Greek world
in the Aegean basin. This civilization

the existence of the seat of a great island empire. Its commerce
and its influence touched all the shores of the Mediterranean,
and it seems to have been in vital touch with the early Babylonian
and Egyptian cultures. Other centers were Mycenae,

<p>Argos, Athens, Pylus, and Sparta, in Europe, and Troy in Asia
Minor.</p>

<p>It was finally destroyed by invasions of barbarians from the
North, much as the Roman Empire finally succumbed to the
Germanic invasions. These invaders were the early Greeks, and
this period is usually called the Homeric Age, because so many of
its features are reflected in the Homeric poems, the Iliad and the
Odyssey.</p>

<p>The times were rude, and social life was primitive. War and
piracy were ordinary pursuits. The people grouped themselves
around powerful chieftains for protection, but marauding bands
were common, which killed, burned, and plundered. Personal
valor and prowess in battle were of supreme importance, not only
for one’s own safety, but for the safety and freedom of his friends
and family as well. Accordingly, the greatest virtue, and the
one held in highest esteem, was bravery in war.</p>

<p>For our picture of the culture of this period we are dependent
upon the Homeric poems. In them we see how expeditions were
made by the Greeks against their enemies, whom they considered
at all times as legitimate objects of plunder. Usually such expeditions
were under one of the many petty Homeric “kings.” Of
these there were a great number; and there was no unity and no
central authority in Homeric Greece any more than there were
in the later historical period.</p>

<p>According to the tradition, the expedition against Troy was
undertaken by the whole of Greece, united under the leadership
of Agamemnon. Some think that this tradition rests upon an
ultimate basis of fact; but this may be merely an idealistic touch,
expressing an earnest hope of the poet, that the various Greek
tribes may reconcile their differences and stop warring on each
other long enough to make war upon the common foe, the barbarians,
as represented by the non-Greek inhabitants of Asia
Minor. In the Homeric poems we find that although Agamemnon
was commander in chief of the allied Greek military expedition,
the various contingents were led by their own commanders, most
of whom were their kings, apparently quite independent of Aga-

memnon when at home, and semi-independent of him during the
jxpedition. The most important of these secondary leaders were :
[Nestor of Pylus, the oldest man in the world; Agamemnon’s
brother, Menelaus, the wronged husband of Helen; the young,
daring, generous, and impetuous Achilles of Phthia; the mighty
Diomedes of Argos, who fought with the very gods themselves;
the wily Odysseus (Ulysses) of Ithaca, who wandered for ten years
after the fall of Troy before he arrived safe at home and saw once
more his wife, the faithful Penelope; the huge and brutal Telamonian
Ajax of Salamis; the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus of Locris;</p>

/</p>

<p>Teucer, the Archer, brother of Telamonian Ajax; and Idomeneus
of Crete, the far-famed isle of a hundred cities.</p>

<p>On the Trojan side the most important characters are: Hector,
eldest son of Priam and commander-in-chief of the Trojan forces;
the aged Priam, King of Troy; Hecuba, his wife; Andromache,
wife of Hector; Paris, brother of Hector and the one who had
brought on the war by stealing Helen; Glaucus and Sarpedon,
princes of Lycia, whose beautiful and unselfish friendship is only
matched by that of Achilles and Patroclus on the Greek side.</p>

<p>The divinities take an active part in the conflict, some siding
with the Greeks, the others with the Trojans. Zeus, who stands

xxxiii
<pb/>

at the head of the gods, as father and king of gods and men, seems
inclined to be neutral. Hera his wife, queen of the gods, cherishes
an implacable hatred against the Trojans, as does Athena, his
daughter, goddess of war, wisdom, and the arts. Poseidon, brother
of Zeus, the mighty god of the sea, is also on the side of the Greeks,
and loses no opportunity to help them. On the Trojan side were
Apollo, god of light, who wards off darkness and evil, patron of
music, poetry and healing; Artemis, his sister, a divinity of the
moonlight, goddess of the woods and wild animals, and patroness
of the chase; Leto, their mother; Aphrodite, born of the white
sea-foam, goddess of love and beauty, who had assisted Paris in
obtaining Helen; Hephaestus, the lame god of fire, patron of all
useful mechanical arts and the working of metals; and the rivergod
Scamander, a stream near Troy.</p>

<p>The gods are distinctly human in their characteristics and
attributes, with human appetites and passions. They differ from
men primarily in being more powerful and in being immortal.
They enjoy a good dinner, where they feast on nectar and ambrosia;
they love and hate, are envious and jealous, but on the whole live
a .happier and serener life than mortals.</p>

<p>In translating Homer, it would be well to hold in mind the four
essential characteristics of his poetry as enumerated by Matthew
Arnold: “ Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his
words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble
in his manner.”</p>

<p>For a good characterization of the Homeric poems, from the
point of view of literary art, one should by all means read Andrew
Lang’s Essay, “ Homer and the Study of Greek,” from which the
following is taken. “Homer is a poet for all ages, all races, and
all moods. To the Greeks the epics were not only the best of
romances, the richest of poetry; not only their oldest documents
about their own history — they were also their Bible, their treasury
of religious traditions and moral teaching. With the Bible and
Shakespeare, the Homeric poems are the best training for life.
There is no good quality that they lack : manliness, courage, reverence
for old age and the hospitable hearth; justice, piety, pity, a

xxxiv
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

brave attitude toward life and death, are all conspicuous in Homer.
He has to write of battles; and he delights in the joy of battle,
and in all the movements of war. Yet he delights not less, but
more, in peace: in prosperous cities, hearths secure, in the tender
beauty of children, in the love of wedded wives, in the frank nobility
of maidens, in the beauty of earth and sky and sea and seaward
murmuring river, in sun and snow, frost and mist and rain, in the
whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and pine tree.

“ living in an age when every man was a warrior, where every
city might know the worst of sack and fire, where the noblest ladies</p>

<p>Storeroom in the Palace at Cnossus

might be led away for slaves, to light the fire and make the bed of
a foreign master, Homer inevitably regards life as a battle. To
each man on earth comes ‘ the wicked day of destiny,’ as Malory
unconsciously translates it, and each man must face it hardily as
he may.

“ Homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and honor.
His heart is with the brave of either side — with Glaucus and Sarpedon
of Lycia no less than with Achilles and Patroclus. ‘Ah
friend,’ cries Sarpedon, ‘if once escaped from this battle we were
for ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I myself fight

xxxv
<pb/>

now in the foremost ranks, nor would I urge thee into the wars that
give renown; but now — for assuredly ten thousand fates of
death on every side beset us, and these may no man shun, nor avoid
— forward let us go, whether we are to give glory or to win it.’
And forth they go, to give and take renown and death, all the
shields and helmets of Lyeia shining behind them, through the
dust of battle, the singing of arrows, the hurtling of spears, the
rain of stones from the Locrian slings. And shields are smitten,
and chariot-horses run wild, with no man to drive them, and Sarpedon
drags down a portion of the Achaean battlement, and Aias
leaps into the trench with his deadly spear, and the whole battle
shifts and shines beneath the sun. Yet he who sings of the war,
and sees it with his sightless eyes, sees also the Trojan women
working at the loom, cheating their anxious hearts with broidery
work of gold and scarlet, or raising the song to Athena, or heating
the bath for Hector, who never again may pass within the gates of
Troy. He sees the poor weaving woman, weighing the wool, that
she may not cheat her employers, and yet may win bread for her
children. He sees the children, the golden head of Astyanax, his
shrinking from the splendor of the hero’s helm. He sees the child
Odysseus, going with his father through the orchard, and choosing
out some apple trees*‘for his very own.’ It is in the mouth of the
ruthless Achilles, the fatal, the fated, the swift-footed hero of
the hands of death, that Homer places the tenderest of his similes.
‘Wherefore weepest thou, Patroclus, like a fond little maid that
runs by her mother’s side, praying her mother to take her up,
snatching at her gown, and hindering her as she walks, and tearfully
looking at her till her mother takes her up ? — Like her,
Patroclus, dost thou fondly weep.’ . . . Such are the moods of
Homer, so full of love of life and all things living, so rich in all
human sympathies, so readily moved when the great hound Argus
welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but the
hound knew him, and died in that welcome. With all this love
of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of
armor, of implement of art; on the divers-colored gold work of the
shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the forging of

xxxvi
<pb/>INTRODUCTION

iron, on the rose-tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on cooking and
eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and their ways, on
fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths where fair maidens
lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered isles with good harbors
and rich land, on plowing, mowing, and sowing, on the furniture of
houses, on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is
laid, — with all this delight in the real, Homer is the most romantic
of poets. He walks with the surest foot in the
darkling realm of dread Persephone, beneath
the poplars of the last beach of Ocean. He has
heard the siren’s music, and the song of Circe,
chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the
golden shuttle through the loom of gold. He
enters the cave of the man-eater; he knows
the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; in the
summer of the North he has looked, from the
fiord of the Laestrygons, on the midnight sun.</p>

<p>He has dwelt on the floating isle of Aeolus,
with its wall of bronze unbroken, and has sailed
on those Phaeacian barks that need no help
of helm or oar, that fear no stress either of
wind or tide, that come and go and return,
obedient to a thought and silent as a dream.</p>

<p>He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters
of wells and woods, and of sacred streams. He
is the second-sighted man, and beholds the
shroud that wraps the living who are doomed, and the mystic
dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed. He has walked in
the garden closes of Phaeacia and looked on the face of gods who
fare thither and watch the weaving of the dance. He has eaten
the honey-sweet fruit of the Lotus, and from the hand of Helen
he brings us that Egyptian Nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of
the mind. His real world is as real as that of Eenry V., his enchanted
isles are charmed with the magic of the Tempest. His
young wooers are as insolent as Claudio, as flushed with youth;
his beggar-men are brethren of Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is

xxxvii
<pb/>

sister to Rosalind, with a different charm of stately purity in love.
His enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is
very beauty; she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and
her repentance is without remorse. His Achilles is youth itself,
glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and loving, and
conscious of its doom. Homer, in truth, is to be matched only
by Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not the occasional
willfulness, freakishness, and modish obscurity. He is a poet
all of gold, universal as humanity, simple as childhood, musical
now as the flow of his own rivers, now as the heavy plunging wave
of his own ocean. . . .

“Such then, as far as weak words can speak of him, is the first
and greatest of poets.”</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Vocabulary. — One of the things most important in learning any
language so as to be able to read it with profit and pleasure is to
acquire a fair-sized vocabulary. In doing this, one should learn
thoroughly the words that are used most. For this purpose there
is a highly practical little book, Homeric Vocabularies, Owen
and Goodspeed, published by the University of Chicago Press.
The most common Homeric words are arranged in it in groups,
according to frequency of occurrence. A copy of this book should
be in the hands of every student who wishes to lighten his work in
learning to read and enjoy Homer.</p>

<p>Forms of the Greek Verb. — In learning the Greek verb, the most
difficult part of Greek grammar, it is highly important to know
which forms are most essential. The following material, with the
two tables, compiled by Professor Robbins, will indicate where the
stress of work should come. These tables will be found valuable,
not only for Homeric Greek, but for other Greek as well. By
emphasizing strongly the forms which are most common, it will
be found that the work will be materially lightened, and the
Greek verb will not be found at all formidable.

“ Table I tabulates the result of counting the verb forms found
on ten pages each of Homer, Euripides, Herodotus, Demosthenes,

xxxviii
<pb/>

and Plato, and on twenty of Xenophon (ten each from the Anabasis
and the Memorabilia). In most cases the pages of the Oxford
Classical Texts or the Bibliotheca Teubneriana have been made
the unit, and for the present purpose the variation in the amount of
Greek on the page need cause no concern. It may be remarked,
also, that first and second perfects have been counted together
because they are best taught together, and that the present
participle of <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἰμι</foreign> has been included among the thematic present
participles.<note n="xxxxix.1">“ Another liberty which I have taken is to disregard perfects of the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> form, reckoning all perfects together. Aorists like <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβην</foreign> are counted as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> forms.”</note>

“The revelations of Table I make clear a few points that have a
definite bearing on the teaching of Greek. In the first place, it
shows that a large majority of the verbs one meets in reading
Greek are confined to a small group of forms. Table II will make
this clearer; it will then appear that nine or ten forms make up
over a half, and twenty-four forms three-quarters, of the verbs
in average Greek. Is it not right that we should first concern
ourselves with teaching these forms ? Of course, one must not
guide himself entirely by these, or any similar, statistics; often it
is advantageous to teach a whole group together, even though this
involves the introduction of certain rather rare forms together with
others that are commoner. On the other hand, here we have a
definite, practical ground for demanding that certain forms be
introduced very early.

“ Among these the present active participle deserves special
mention. The statistics show the high frequency of its occurrence,
and indeed few sentences, save the most elementary, can be mastered
without a knowledge of it. Furthermore, its inflection can
easily be made an introduction to both the first and third declensions,
and one should not readily pass by an opportunity to kill
three birds with one stone.

“ The apparently high frequency of the present and imperfect
indicative and the present infinitive of -μι verbs is due not so
much to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἵστημι</foreign>,  <foreign xml:lang="greek">τίθημι</foreign>,  <foreign xml:lang="greek">δίδώμι</foreign>, and  <foreign xml:lang="greek">δείκνυμι</foreign> as to the constant

<head>Lesson I: introductory</head>

<p>1. Learn the alphabet and sounds of the letters, breathings, and quantity, <ref>501-508</ref>, <ref>519-520</ref>, <ref>521-533</ref><note>The figures refer to sections of the book.</note>

2. Optional:<note>Sections to be assigned at the discretion of the instructor.</note>

3. The easiest and simplest way to learn the sounds of
the letters is to use the two right-hand columns of 501 for
practice,3 covering with a card the English transliteration
(the column to the extreme right).

4. WORD LIST FOR PRACTICE IN PRONUNCIATION

Spell and pronounce: <note>In spelling these words it is not necessary to have memorized the namesof the Greek letters, but the sounds should be familiar. Thus, for the present, α may be called a, β may be called b, γ may be called g, etc.</note>

An Athenian School
Royal Museum, Berlin

A painting by Duris on a drinking-cup, or cylix. The picture is divided by the two handles.
In the upper half, beginning at the left: a youth playing the double flute as a lesson to the boy
before him; a teacher holding a tablet and stylus and correcting a composition ; a slave (paedagogus),
who accompanied the children to and from school. In the lower half: a master teaching
his pupil to play the tyre; a teacher holding a half-opened roll, listening to a recitation by
the student before him; a bearded paedagogus. The inner picture, badly damaged, represents
a youth in a bath.

<p>Accents.—There are three accents, the acute ( <foreign xml:lang="greek">´</foreign>), the

<div type="textpart" n="535">
<p>These accents are all ordinarily pronounced alike, by
stressing the accented syllable, as in English. In ancient Greek
they seem to have represented a difference of pitch.

syllables only of a word, the circumflex on one of the last two
only, and the grave on the last only.

<p>The circumflex accent can stand only over a long vowel
or a diphthong.

<div type="textpart" n="538">
<p>If diphthongs (except improper ones, 505) have either
the accent or breathing, or both, these must come over the second
vowel, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτούς</foreign> <gloss>themselves</gloss>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὕνεκα</foreign> <gloss>because</gloss>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὗτος</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">Οὗτος</foreign>) this.

<div type="textpart" n="539">
<p>For improper diphthongs, these come over the first vowel
if it is written in small letters, and before it if it is an initial
capital followed by small letters.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="540">
<p>If a vowel or a diphthong has both the accent and

THE PARTHENON
After serving as a temple for about nine centuries, the Parthenon was turned into a Christian
church, and later into a Mohammedan mosque. In 1687 a.d. the Venetians bombarded Athens
and sent a shell into the center of the building, which the Turks had used as a powder magazine.
The result was an explosion that threw down the side walls and many of the columns.

<p>Thematic and Athematic forms.—With respect to form
Greek verbs fall into two main classes :</p>

<p>1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">-ω</foreign> verbs, i.e. those ending in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-ω</foreign> in the first person singular,
present active indicative, sometimes called thematic verbs (796).</p>

<p>2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> verbs, i.e. those ending in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-μι</foreign> in the first person singular,
present active indicative, sometimes called athematic verbs (797).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="796">
<p>The thematic verbs are so named because in a majority
of their forms the personal ending (819-821) is preceded by <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο/ε</foreign>
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ν</foreign>, or in the optative mode, otherwise <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε</foreign>), which is
called the thematic vowel. Thus, <foreign xml:lang="greek">λυε/ο-</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">λύω</foreign>) is called the theme,
to which the personal endings (819-821) are attached.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="797">
<p>Athematic verbs do not have this connecting vowel, but the
personal endings are attached directly to the stem of the verb.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="798">
<p>Many verbs which are regularly thematic may have
athematic forms, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέχθαι</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέκτο</foreign> (δέχομαι) ; <foreign xml:lang="greek">λύμην</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">λύτο</foreign> (λύω) ; <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἇλτο

<div type="textpart" n="799">
<p>In the subjunctive these thematic vowels, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο/ε</foreign>, are regularly
long, being <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω/η</foreign> respectively.</p>

<p>In some cases the thematic vowel is short in the subjunctive,
particularly in the dual and plural of the present and second

and the second aorist of all verbs having athematic second aorists
in the indicative.</p>

Verbs</foreign></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="830">
<p>Augment. — Greek verbs prefix an augment (increase) at
the beginning of the secondary (816) tenses of the indicative,
to denote past time.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="831">
<p>This augment is of two kinds :</p>

<p>1) syllabic augment, which prefixes ἐ- to verbs beginning with a
consonant, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">λύω</foreign> I loose, imperfect <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλυον</foreign> I was loosing.</p>

<p>2) temporal augment, which lengthens the first syllable of words
beginning with a vowel or a diphthong, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀκούω</foreign> I hear, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἤκουον
I</foreign> was hearing.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="832">
<p>When augmented <foreign xml:lang="greek">α</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε</foreign> regularly become <foreign xml:lang="greek">η;</foreign> ι, o, <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign> become <foreign xml:lang="greek">ῑ,
ω</foreign>, ῡ respectively; <foreign xml:lang="greek">αι</foreign> and ᾳ become ῃ; while <foreign xml:lang="greek">οι</foreign> becomes ῳ.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="833">
<p>Of course <foreign xml:lang="greek">η</foreign>, ῃ, ῑ, ῡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, and ῳ do not undergo any change
when augmented.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="834">
<p>Verbs beginning with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ρ</foreign> regularly double it after the
augment. Those beginning with <foreign xml:lang="greek">λ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign>, v, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> sometimes double
the initial consonant after the augment.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="835">
<p>Verbs beginning with a vowel formerly preceded by a lost
consonant (usually p, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign>), may take the syllabic instead of the
temporal augment, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑανδάνω</foreign>, imperfect of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἁνδάνω</foreign> (σϜανδάνω)
please.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="836">
<p>When initial <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> has thus been lost, the augment always

contracts with the first vowel of the stem, according to the rules
(584-5); when initial <foreign xml:lang="greek">ϝ</foreign> has been lost, contraction may or may not
take place. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔχω</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">σεχω</foreign>), imperfect <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἶχον</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">σέσε-χον</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔεχον</foreign>) ·
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ἕπομαι</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">σέπομαι</foreign>), imperfect <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἰπόμην</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">σεσεπόμην</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐεεπόμην</foreign>) ; <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἴδον</foreign>
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔϜιδον</foreign>), second aorist of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὁράω</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">Ϝοράω</foreign>) ; <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄγνμι</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ϝάγῡνυμι</foreign>, aorist <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔαξα</foreign>
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔϜαξα</foreign>).</p>

<div type="textpart" n="837">
<p>The augment, both syllabic and temporal, is often omitted.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="838">
<p>Compound Verbs. — Some prepositions (originally adverbs)
are prefixed to verbs, the whole forming a compound. If the
preposition ends with a vowel and the verb begins with one, the
vowel of the preposition is usually elided (575), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">διίστημι
(διά-ἵστημι</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀφαιρέω</foreign> (ἀπό-αἱρέω (582)).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="839">
<p>The augment of compound verbs comes between the
preposition and the verb. If two vowels are thus brought
together, the first is usually elided, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀπολύω</foreign> loose, free ; imperfect
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀπέλυον</foreign> (ἀπό-ἔλυον) ; aorist <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀπέλυσα</foreign> (ἀπό-ἔλῡσα).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="840">
<p>Imperfect. — The imperfect (a secondary tense (816)) is
formed by adding the secondary endings (821) to the augmented
stem of the present, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">λύω</foreign> I loose, imperfect <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλυον</foreign> I was loosing<foreign xml:lang="greek">;

<p>Second Tenses. — Many verbs have what are called second
tenses, as second aorists (active, middle, and passive), and second
perfects and pluperfects (active). These second tenses are irregular
in formation, and are thus named to distinguish them from
the more common, regularly formed tenses, which are called first
tenses.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="865">
<p>Second aorists are formed in various ways :</p>

<p>1) A common method is for them to have the secondary (816)
endings, following the thematic vowel <foreign xml:lang="greek">ε/ο</foreign>, thus being conjugated
like the imperfect, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔχω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἕξω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔσχον</foreign> to have, where <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔσχον</foreign> the
second aorist is conjugated like <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλυον</foreign>, the imperfect of <foreign xml:lang="greek">λὐω</foreign> to loose.</p>

<p>2) Many have the secondary endings attached directly to the
tense stem, and thus are conjugated like the aorist passive, hut
without the <foreign xml:lang="greek">Θ</foreign> of the passive stem. Thus <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔβην</foreign> (βαίνω), <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔδῡν</foreign> (δύω),
ἔγνων (γιγνώσκω), etc. These are athematic (797) of course.</p>

<p>3) Others end in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-α</foreign> and are conjugated with the same endings
as the first (regular) aorists, hut without the <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">εἶπα</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔκηα.</foreign></p>

<p>4) Many are reduplicated (867), as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἤγαγον [ἄγω]</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">κεχαρόμην

[χαίρω].

Note.</foreign> — The stem of the second aorist usually diSers from the
present, regularly standing in ablaut (593-5) relation to it, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">βαίνω,
ἔβην; λείπω</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔλιπον.

Note. — Observe that the long doubtful vowels (519) are not
marked in the Homeric passages (520), as their length must be learned
from the metre.

63.
1. <foreign xml:lang="greek">μἦνιν</foreign> is emphatic, by position, as the central theme of the Iliad. It is the mad wrath of Achilles, and its terrible consequences to the Greeks, which the poet uses as a thread for his plot. —
 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἀείδε [άειδω]</foreign> : pres. act. imperat., 2d sing., sing, i.e. inspire me with thy gift of song, <ref>1069</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεά</foreign> (the muse of song) is vocative. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδεω</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδᾱο</foreign> <ref>573</ref> (probably <foreign xml:lang="greek">Πηληιάδᾱ’ Ἀχιλῆος</foreign> stood here originally).

2. <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐλομένην</foreign> is emphatic as being at the bead of the verse, and at the
end of its clause, and out of the natural order. It is in a kind of apposition
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν</foreign>, as though it were an afterthought, and is expanded and

<pb n="22"/>

amplified by the following clause. —

ἥ [ὅs, ἥ, ὅ <ref>773</ref>] refers to <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν- —
μῡρί’ Ἀχαιοῖς</foreign> : for the hiatus see <ref>576</ref> ; <ref>1178.3</ref>.

3. Merely a picturesque way of saying “killed.” — <foreign xml:lang="greek">προΐαψεν:</foreign> <ref>830-831</ref>, <ref>837</ref>.—

Ἄιδι, = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἌϜιδι.</foreign> To the ancient Greeks the realm of Hades
was not primarily a place of punishment, of tortures, and of horrors, as
the Christian Hell, but was a faint and cheerless copy of the upper world,
and was the abode of all departed spirits of the dead. Consequently no
one, no matter how good and pious, was anxious to die.

4. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἡρώων</foreign> is emphatic, as coming at the beginning of the verse, and
out of its natural order. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">δὲ ἑλώρια</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">δε Ϝελώρια</foreign> (<ref>580</ref>). — <foreign xml:lang="greek">αὐτούς</foreign> : themselves, i.e. their bodies, as contrasted with their shadows, or souls.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">τεῦχε</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔτευχε</foreign> : <ref>837</ref>. In order for the soul of the deceased to obtain rest,
it was necessary that the body be buried, or cremated, with the proper
funeral rites. If the enemy gained possession of his foe’s body, as a
mark of the worst he could do, he might give it over to the dogs and
birds to devour. This heightened the pathos of the poet’s theme. The
scene on the opposite page shows how bitterly the old Greeks and Trojans
fought for the bodies of the slain. Achilles, who has been shot through
the heel by Paris, lies dead in the midst of the fray. The Trojans have
pounced upon his body, eager to drag it within their own lines. Glaucus,
one of their number, while attempting to tie a thong to the foot of
Achilles, falls mortally wounded by Ajax, who is stoutly defending the
corpse. Other Trojans, including Paris, Aeneas, Laodocus, and Echippus,
have joined in the battle.

5. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐτελεῖετο [τελείω]</foreign> : imperf. pass, indic., 3d sing., was being accomplished.

These verses, together with the two following, form the prooemium,
or introduction to the Iliad. The subject is announced in the very first
word (μῆνις). It is the wrath of Achilles and its disastrous consequences
to the Greeks, but all in accordance with the will of Zeus,
which form the principal theme of the poem.

64. Translate :

1. The valiant Achaeans are singing the accursed wrath of Achilles.

2. The wrath of Achilles caused many woes to the Achaeans and sent many valiant souls of heroes to the god Hades.

3. We shall make the army of the Achaeans a booty for the dogs and a banquet for the birds.

4. We are accomplishing the will of the goddess.

<p>1) Masculine and feminine stems, except those ending in v, p,

<p>2) Masculine and feminine stems ending in p, <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> and most of
those ending in v make no change except to lengthen the last
vowel if it is short.</p>

<p>3) Stems ending in v(t) either make no change except to
lengthen the last vowel if it is short, dropping final <foreign xml:lang="greek">τ</foreign> wherever
it occurs, or else they add <foreign xml:lang="greek">σ</foreign> to the stem and make the usual
euphonic changes (613), loss of v(t) and lengthening of the preceding
vowel. Thus the stems : <foreign xml:lang="greek">δαιρ,ον-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">θϊν-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ρ,ελαν-</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">γεροντ-</foreign> give the

<p>2) Copy and mark the scansion of the first five verses of the Iliad.

66. Remember that the only vowels the quantity of which
is not known are <foreign xml:lang="greek">α</foreign>, ι, <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign> and that their length is indicated in
the vocabulary. As soon as possible the student should
master the rules for the length of vowels of the inflectional
endings, so as to be free from the vocabulary in this particular.

67. In marking the scansion of these verses, use the sign
(ˉ) to indicate a long syllable, and the sign (˘) for a short
syllable, separating the feet from each other by the perpendicular
line ( | )·

68. The written word-accent must be disregarded in reading
the verse.

69. Iliad 1-5


70. The first syllable of <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῆνιν</foreign> must be long, having a long
vowel, <ref>522</ref>. The accent shows that the second syllable must
be short, <ref>545</ref>, <ref>1160</ref>. Then, having one long and one short,
the next syllable (ἄ-) must be short, as when there is one
long followed by a short, there must be another short to
complete the foot, <ref>1169</ref>.

The next syllable (-ει-) is long, being a diphthong, <ref>521-522</ref>.

<pb n="24"/>

The next syllable (-δε) is short, having a short vowel followed
by a single consonant.

The next syllable (θε-) is short also, having a short vowel
followed by another vowel.

As this completes this foot, the final syllable (-ά) of <foreign xml:lang="greek">θεά</foreign> .
must be long, as it is the first, syllable of the next foot, <ref>1171</ref>.

The next syllable (Πη-) is long, having a long vowel, <ref>522</ref>.

The next syllable (-λη-) is long, having a long vowel, <ref>522</ref>.

The next vowel (-ι-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-ά-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next vowel (-ε-) is short, but as the first syllable of a
foot must be long, <ref>1171</ref>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">-δεω</foreign> is pronounced as one long
syllable, by synizesis, <ref>586</ref>.

The next vowel (Ἀ-) is short. See the vocabulary.

Then the next syllable (-χι-) must be short to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-λῆ-) is long, having a long vowel.

The final syllable (-ος) is short, having a short vowel, but
must be marked long here, as the final syllable is always long,
owing to the pause in the verse, <ref>1184</ref>.

Therefore the metrical scheme of this verse is:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |


Now mark the next verse : <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐλομένην</foreign>, ἣ <foreign xml:lang="greek">μῡρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε’
ἔθηκεν,

The</foreign> first syllable (οὐ-) is long, being a diphthong.

The second syllable (-λο-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-μέ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next (-νην) is long, having a long vowel.

The next (ἣ) is long, having a long vowel.

As this completes the second foot, the next syllable (μυ-)
must be long, as it is the first syllable of the next foot.

The next syllable (-ρί’) is short, as is indicated by the accent,
since only short vowels are elided, <ref>575</ref>, <ref>1162</ref>.

<pb n="25"/>

Then the next syllable (Ἀ-) must be short, to complete
the foot.

The next syllable (-χαι-) is long, having a diphthong.

The next syllable (-οῖς) is long, having a diphthong.

The next-syllable (ἄλ-) is long,followed by two consonants.

The next syllable (-γε’) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (ἔ-) is short, having a short vowel.

The next syllable (-θη-) is long, having a long vowel.

The next syllable (-κεν) is short, but is long here, owing
to its place in the verse, <ref>1184</ref>.

Therefore this verse should be scanned as follows:

ˉ ˘ ˘ | ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ | ˉ ˘ ˘ |ˉ ˉ |

71. Using these principles, and the rules given, <ref>1159-1192</ref>,
mark the scansion of the first five verses, and do not attempt
any further work in Homer till these have been thoroughly
memorized and can be repeated rhythmically with ease.

72. A good plan to follow at first is to mark only the syllables
of which the quantity is certain, without having to
consult the vocabulary. When this is done, the quantity of
the remaining syllables can usually be determined from their
position in the verse.

73. Before attempting to memorize a verse, it should always
be translated several times, till the student is quite
familiar with the exact meaning of every word and understands
accurately every construction in it.

74. First the teacher may repeat these verses a few times
for the students, then with them, till they have the movement
mastered, but after that the students should be able to
recite them alone.

75. Let each student recite these separately, then let them
be repeated by small groups, and finally in concert by the
entire class.

76. In repeating these verses orally, the words must of
course be kept distinct and no break must be made between

<p>The metre of the Homeric poems is the dactylic (sometimes
called the heroic) hexameter, the most common of all Greek verse.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1180">
<p>There are six feet to the verse, the first five being either
dactyls (that is, one long followed by two shorts — w w), or its

equivalent, the spondee (that is, two longs---). The sixth foot

is always a spondee.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1181">
<p>In dactylic hexameter the ictus (verse accent) is always
on the first syllable of each foot.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1182">
<p>The fifth foot is usually a dactyl, only about one verse in
twenty having a spondee in this place, which gives the verse a
movement slower than usual. It is then called a spondaic verse.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1183">
<p>In each foot one part is distinguished from the other by
a slight stress of voice, called the ictus.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1184">
<p>The final syllable of a verse may be either long or short,
hut as there is a slight pause here, the final syllable in hexameter
is always considered long, making the last foot of the verse always
a spondee, 1180.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1185">
<p>Whenever a word ends within a foot, it is called caesura.
If this coincides with a pause in the verse, it is called the caesura

the Homeric poems to make the verse more melodious and to aid
in its recital.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1186">

<p>Whenever the end of a word coincides with the end of

called the diaeresis of the verse.

</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1189">
<p>The most important diaeresis is the one which comes at
the end of the fourth foot. From its common employment in
pastoral poetry it is called the bucolic diaeresis.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1190">
<p>For metrical purposes all vowels and syllables of Greek
words may be divided into long and short.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="1191">
<p>The rhythm of Greek verse is based upon the regular
succession of long and short syllables.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1192">
<p>To obtain facility in reading the verse, a considerable
quantity of it should be memorized, special attention being paid
to the quantity (that is, twice as much time should be given to
each long syllable as to a short), and the pauses should be carefully
observed. Although English verse is primarily accentual
rather than quantitative, still the memorizing of a few lines of
English dactylic hexameter (Longfellow’s “ Evangeline,”1 for
example, mediocre though it be) will materially aid in getting the
swing and the movement of the Greek hexameter.

1 This is the forest primaeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,

Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.

On the first seven verses, read 63 (end), and compare Hermann Grimm :
“ These first verses are like the tones of a funeral march rising to a sky
shrouded with gloomy clouds. A series of verses which like heralds
announce the whole poem. A gloomy cloud gathers over the Greeks.
The field is covered with the corpses of fallen heroes. Dogs and vultures
tear the bodies of the slain. The most powerful of men and the mightiest
mortal descendant of Zeus quarrel. Zeus has determined the destruction
of the people. All this in a single sentence which closes with
<foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀχιλλεύς.”

With</foreign> fine poetic insight Homer begins his story in the very middle
with a thrilling situation, and allows the background with what has gone
before to unfold itself gradually, as it is needed, in the course of his
narrative.

In order to create a situation which would inevitably bring on a quarrel
so far-reaching in its consequences, it is not enough for merely human
factors and natural causes to operate, but some divinity must motivate
the action. This gives the poet a wider range for his creative imagination,
and makes anything possible.

Observe that this verse ends in two spondees, making it a “spondaic”
verse. This, together with the position of the final word, throws special
emphasis upon it, making it practically equivalent to “ although he was
a priest,” which would of course make him an object of more than ordinary
reverence.

12. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀτρεΐδης</foreign>  is made distinctly emphatic by position. It is he who
must bear the burden of responsibility in slighting the priest. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐπὶ νῆας</foreign>, i.e. to the Greek camp on the shore, where they had drawn up their
ships, out of the water.

13. <foreign xml:lang="greek">λῡσόμενος [λύω]:</foreign> fut. mid. particip., nom. sing. masc. (modifying
ὁ, which refers to the priest) peing about (desiring) to ransom, to ransom,
1109, 5. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">φέρων [φέρω]</foreign> : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (also modifies
ὀ), bearing, bringing.<foreign xml:lang="greek">—

ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα</foreign> is an example of epic exaggeration, not rare in all such compositions.

14. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἔχων [ἔχω]</foreign> : pres. act. part., nom. sing. masc. (modifies ὁ), having,
holding. The ransoms were probably of gold and silver bullion and other
valuable articles of commerce.

The priest depends upon two motives to influence the Greeks:</p>

<p>1) Cupidity, and so he brings the presents, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄποινα.</foreign></p>

<p>2) Reverence, which accounts for his wearing the fillets (ribbons of
white wool) and bearing the. sceptre as insignia of his office.

— <foreign xml:lang="greek">χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου:</foreign> originally <foreign xml:lang="greek">χερσὶ Ϝεκηβόλου.</foreign> — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος</foreign> : <ref>571</ref>, <ref>1173</ref>. Apollo has the epithet “free-shooter,” “sharp-shooter” applied
to him here, introducing him in his capacity as archer god, so
important for the further action, where he slays the Greeks with his
arrows. In his capacity as god of war, Jehovah was also an archer god
at times. “God is a righteous judge. He hath bent his bow and made
it ready.” Compare the story of the rainbow: “I shall set my bow (i.e.
my symbol as warrior god) in the cloud.”

15. <foreign xml:lang="greek">χρῡσ-έῳ</foreign> : synizesis, <ref>586</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">χρῡσέω ἀνά</foreign> : <ref>1173</ref>. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">καὶ ἐλίσσετο</foreign> : <ref>1173</ref>.
The latter part of this verse would imply that the scene takes place at a
meeting of the assembly of the Greeks.

The sceptre was a symbol of authority. Of course it was of gold if it
is to appear decently in epic. The whole atmosphere of a poem of this
kind is supramundane. Its leading characters are divine or semi-divine,
and their equipment must all be of more precious material than that

which suffices for ordinary mortals. Thus Apollo has a golden sword.
Several of the warriors before Troy have golden armor, and the gods
sit on golden thrones which rest upon the golden pavements of their
palaces in Olympus. In the same way the new Jerusalem has streets
of gold and gates of pearl. — <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐλίσσετο [λίσσομαι]</foreign> : imperf. act. ind. 3d sing, deponent verb. Observe the force of the imperfect, the old priest
kept entreating Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus, but Agamemnon,
in spite of these repeated opportunities to avail himself of the mercy of
the god, chose deliberately to slight his holy ambassador.

16. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ἀτρεΐδᾱ</foreign> = Menelaus and Agamemnon.

The priest is a native of Chrysa, a small town near Troy, which has
been plundered by the invading Greeks. His daughter has been taken
prisoner of war, and he now comes to the Greek camp, where the ships
have been drawn up on the shore, to ransom her.

1. Chryses, the priest of Apollo, is dishonored by (dative) the son of Atreus.
2. The Achaeans will go from (their) swift ships to Troy and ransom the beloved daughter of the priest.
3. We shall bring many ransoms and shall hold in (our) hands the fillets of Apollo.
4. We do not have a golden sceptre, hut we entreat Priam and all the people of Troy.
5. The two sons of Atreus, marshallers of the people(s), are entreating Priam, but he will slight them.
6. The son of Atreus, king of men, slighted the priest and did not release (his) daughter.

20. From its position in the verse <foreign xml:lang="greek">παῖδα</foreign> is emphatic. “ It is my child

the rhyme of <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέχεσθαι.</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱκέσθαι</foreign> in vs. 19. The old priest would thus
emphasize that their return home, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἱκέσθαι</foreign>, may depend upon their acceptance,

to the gifts he had brought.

18 ff. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ὑμῖν θεοὶ δοϊεν</foreign>, etc.: “ may you get your wish, I mine.” Evidently
he does not object to having the Greeks collect part of their
payment from Priam and his people, who were of considerably less concern
to the priest than his own darling daughter. Homer’s characters
are often thus refreshingly individualistic. If the Greeks would grant his
request, he was willing to have his prayers enlisted on their side. He
was not the first, nor yet the last, to labor under the impression that the
outcome of a great war might be influenced by a personal appeal to his
god.

Instead of having his speech reported at second hand, the priest is
dramatically brought forward in propria persona, and speaks for himself.
The poet thus secures a more striking effect than indirect discourse
could produce.

<p>Contraction. —When one vowel follows another vowel in

o 4- i = oi, etc.

Note.—Observe that the long vowels ἀ, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, when followed by i

<p>1) The only tenses which occur in the infinitive are the
present, future, aorist, perfect, and future perfect. The middle
and passive differ in form in the aorist only.</p>

<p>2) In the subjunctive, optative, imperative, and infinitive, the
tenses do not of themselves indicate time.</p>

<p>3) The present in these moods denotes an action simply as
continued.</p>

<p>4) The aorist denotes an action simply as brought to pass.</p>

<p>5) The perfect denotes an action simply as completed.</p>

<p>6) The subject of an infinitive is usually in the accusative,
but may be omitted when it is the subject of the leading verb, or
its direct or indirect object.</p>

<p>7) The infinitive may be the subject of a verb, especially an
impersonal one, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐστί(ν)</foreign>.</p>

<p>8) It may be the object of a verb, especially verbs indicating
wish, command, advice, consent, attempt,'and the like.</p>

<p>9) The infinitive may depend upon adjectives or substantives,
especially those denoting ability, fitness, willingness, or have a
similar meaning to verbs which take the infinitive (<ref>1107, 7</ref>).</p>

<p>10) The infinitive also may express purpose; the negative is <foreign xml:lang="greek">μή</foreign>.</p>

<p>11) The infinitive is used also to express a command with the
nominative of the second person,- or with the accusative of the
third person for the subject if expressed; the subject may be
omitted. In this usage it is the equivalent of the imperative.

<p>Sonant Consonants. — In an earlier stage of the language,
the liquids (λ, p) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign>, v of the nasals were often vocalic
(sonant) ; that is, they were used as vowels in certain combinations.
In this case they are ordinarily written with a small circle

underneath, to distinguish them from the consonantal <foreign xml:lang="greek">λ</foreign>, p, <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign>, v.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="598">
<p>In G-reek as we know the language:</p>

<p>1) Vocalic <foreign xml:lang="greek">λ</foreign> (λ), becomes consonantal (λ) and a strengthening

for an earlier <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ιστλμαι; πίμπλαντο</foreign> were filled, for an earlier <foreign xml:lang="greek">πι(μ</foreign>)-
πλντο; <foreign xml:lang="greek">πολύς</foreign> much, for an earlier <foreign xml:lang="greek">πλνς.</foreign></p>

<p>2) Similarly vocalic p (p) becomes consonantal (p), and a

<p>3) Vocalic <foreign xml:lang="greek">μ</foreign> (μ) becomes short a, as in <foreign xml:lang="greek">δέκα</foreign> ten, for an earlier

<foreign xml:lang="greek">δ«κρ</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">Ιλϋσα</foreign> I loosed, for ah earlier <foreign xml:lang="greek">έλνσμ.

o</foreign> o</p>

<p>4) Vocalic v (v) also becomes short a, as in the ending -a of the

accusative singular, and the ending -as of the accusative plural,

masculine and feminine, of the third declension, for an earlier -v

• °
and -vs. Compare <foreign xml:lang="greek">πόδα</foreign> (acc. sing.) foot with Lat. pedem, which

To</foreign> get the full effect of this situation, it must be, remembered that
the girl had been captured by the marauding Greeks, on a pillaging
expedition near Troy, and in the distribution of the booty she had
fallen to the lot of Agamemnon, whose personal property she now is.
So the old priest has little difficulty in winning over “ all the other
Achaeans,” who vociferously assent to his proposition ; but Agamemnon,
the only one who has anything to lose by the transaction, does not
prove to be so easy. Apparently he was not yet ready to return a choice
prize in exchange for a few pieces of gold and silver, or some old pots aud
pans and the paltry prayers of a pious priest. The piety of the other
Greeks and their reverence for the priest are placed in marked contrast
to the action of Agamemnon, who alone is wicked, and obstinately so.
His course is further robbed of any possible redeeming feature by the

<pb n="39"/>


fact that he is not only an ungodly sinner, but is actually rude and ill-mannered
to the priest. In requital for all this, as we shall learn in the
sequel, the people are the chief sufferers, who perish in heaps, while
Agamemnon escapes the plague. This is really an artistic blemish and
offends one’s sense of poetic justice. But it is necessary for the later
development of the plot that the king be preserved alive, and besides
throughout all history “ when the king sins the people suffer.” For an
illuminating parallel, read 2 Sam. 24 inter alia.

Agamemnon is too angry to consider any of the points urged by the
priest, and does not even thank him for his prayer for the success of the
expedition and a safe journey homeward (vss. 18-19), but takes that
all for granted (see vs. 30, next lesson). He respects neither god nor
priest, and prefers the girl to the ransom. In addressing the priest curtly
as <foreign xml:lang="greek">γέρον</foreign>, old man, he disregards his appeal as a representative of the god.

<p>Contraction. —When one vowel follows another vowel in
the same word, contraction sometimes (but not usually) takes
place. When vowels are thus contracted, the following are the
rules:</p>

<p>1) Vowels which regularly form diphthongs do so, as a 4-1 = at,
o 4- i = oi, etc.

Note.—Observe that the long vowels ἀ, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, when followed by i
regularly form the improper diphthongs a, y, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign> (505).</p>

<p>2) Two like sounds unite in the common long sound, that is,
two a-sounds (a), two e-sounds (e, <foreign xml:lang="greek">η</foreign>), two i-sounds (i), two

<pb n="218"/>ELISION, CONTRACTION, SYNIZESIS [585-586

o-sounds (ο, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>), or two u-sounds (υ), unite to form the common
long (ά, ἡ, l, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, ΰ) sounds, except ee becomes a, and oo becomes <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐ.</foreign></p>

<p>3) An o-sound absorbs an abound or an e-sound and becomes
long <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> (ω), except to gives tv, while ot becomes ov.</p>

<p>4) If an abound comes together with an e-sound, the one which
comes first absorbs the other and becomes long (α, <foreign xml:lang="greek">-η</foreign>).</p>

<p>5) A vowel coming before a diphthong beginning with the
same vowel may be, absorbed, and t may be absorbed before oi.
In other cases a vowel before a diphthong may be contracted
with the first vowel of the diphthong, a following iota becoming
iota subscript (505), and a following <foreign xml:lang="greek">υ</foreign> disappearing.</p>

<p>1) The only tenses which occur in the infinitive are the
present, future, aorist, perfect, and future perfect. The middle

<p>2) In the subjunctive, optative, imperative, and infinitive, the
tenses do not of themselves indicate time.</p>

<p>3) The present in these moods denotes an action simply as
continued.</p>

<p>4) The aorist denotes an action simply as brought to pass.</p>

<p>5) The perfect denotes an action simply as completed.</p>

<p>6) The subject of an infinitive is usually in the accusative,
but may be omitted when it is the subject of the leading verb, or
its direct or indirect object.</p>

<p>7) The infinitive may be the subject of a verb, especially an
impersonal one, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἐστί(ν)</foreign>.</p>

<p>8) It may be the object of a verb, especially verbs indicating
wish, command, advice, consent, attempt,'and the like.</p>

especially those denoting ability, fitness, willingness, or have a
similar meaning to verbs which take the infinitive (<ref>1107, 7</ref>).</p>

<p>10) The infinitive also may express purpose; the negative is <foreign xml:lang="greek">μή</foreign>.</p>

<p>11) The infinitive is used also to express a command with the
nominative of the second person,- or with the accusative of the
third person for the subject if expressed; the subject may be
omitted. In this usage it is the equivalent of the imperative.

endure all this in a far-away land in the midst of strangers, who might
not always be sympathetic. The illustration on the preceding page
shows the entrance to the fortified enclosure containing' Agamemnon’s
palace, where he intended the daughter of the priest to serve him.
It is characteristic of the poet’s art that Agamemnon is represented
as leaving to the imagination just what dire form his brutality may
take, although his threat perhaps contains an intimation that if the old

life. Having no good arguments or adequate reasons to offer, Agamemnon
resorts to vile abuse to close the discussion and get rid of his
unwelcome visitor. Homer represents the brutality of Agamemnon in
as glaring a light as possible, to prepare the way for the righteous
indignation of the god and the fearful consequences which the Greek
hosts are to suffer for the king’s rash impiety.

<p>Contraction. —When one vowel follows another vowel in
the same word, contraction sometimes (but not usually) takes
place. When vowels are thus contracted, the following are the
rules:</p>

<p>1) Vowels which regularly form diphthongs do so, as a 4-1 = at,
o 4- i = oi, etc.

Note.—Observe that the long vowels ἀ, ἡ, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign>, when followed by i
regularly form the improper diphthongs a, y, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ω</foreign> (505).</p>

<p>3) An o-sound absorbs an abound or an e-sound and becomes
long <foreign xml:lang="greek">ο</foreign> (ω), except to gives tv, while ot becomes ov.</p>

<p>4) If an abound comes together with an e-sound, the one which

<p>5) A vowel coming before a diphthong beginning with the

In other cases a vowel before a diphthong may be contracted
with the first vowel of the diphthong, a following iota becoming

<p>A finite verb regularly agrees with its subject nominative
in person and number, except:</p>

<p>1) A neuter plural subject may take its verb in the singular, as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ωχετο κηλa θεοίo</foreign> the shafts of the god sped, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τὰ 8έ8ασται</foreign> these have
been distributed.</p>

<p>2) With two or more subjects connected by and, the verb
may agree with one of the subjects and be understood with the
rest, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">μὴ</foreign> vv tol <foreign xml:lang="greek">ον χραίσμη σκηπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοίο</foreign> lest the Sceptre
and the fillet of the god avail thee naught, el <foreign xml:lang="greek">8η δμον πόλεμός</foreign> re <foreign xml:lang="greek">8αμά
καὶ λοιμός ἀχαιονς</foreign> if war and pestilence at the same time crush the
Achaeans.</p>

<p>3) When referring to two, the plural and dual are often interchanged
or united, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">δανώ</foreign> 8έ <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὶ ἀσσε φάανθεν</foreign> and her eyes appeared
terrible, <foreign xml:lang="greek">τώ</foreign> ol <foreign xml:lang="greek">ίσον κηρϋκε καὶ δτρηρω θεράποντε</foreign> who were his two

<p>Many verbs which in English are transitive are intransitive
in Greek and take the dative. The verbs of this class are mainly
those meaning serve, benefit, defend, assist, please, obey, trust,
satisfy, advise, exhort, and their opposites; also those signifying
abuse, anger, blame, envy, friendliness, hostility, reproach, threats,
etc., as <foreign xml:lang="greek">βασιλῆι χολωθείς</foreign> <gloss>incensed at the king</gloss>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">οὐκ Ἀτρείδῇ ἥνδανε θυμῷ</foreign> <gloss>it was not pleasing to the son of Atreus in his soul</gloss>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">μή vύ τοι οὐ

<div type="textpart" n="1085">
<p>The adverbs <foreign xml:lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">κέ(ν)</foreign> are often used to qualify the
meaning of the moods ; they are used in two ways:

<pb n="329"/></p>

<p>1) In independent clauses they are used with the subjunctive,
the optative, and with the past and future tenses of the indicative;
and also with the participle and infinitive, when they represent
the independent indicative and optative.</p>

<p>2) In dependent clauses, usually with the subjunctive.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1086">
<p>These adverbs usually give a touch of indefiniteness to
the clause in which they stand. They have no exact equivalent
in English. When they appear in the conclusion of conditional
sentences, they are usually translated by <emph>could</emph>, or <emph>would</emph>, in
English.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1087">
<p>The subjunctive with these adverbs is used almost the
same as the future indicative, or the potential optative (1105).</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1088">
<p>They are used in simple sentences and in the apodosis
(conclusion) of complex sentences to express limitation by circumstances
or conditions.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1089">
<p>They are regularly found in final clauses referring to the
future.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1090">
<p>They are usually found in conditional clauses in the
optative and in the subjunctive, when the governing verb is
future, or in a mood which implies futurity.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="1091">
<p>They are not ordinarily used in conditional, relative,
and temporal clauses with the subjunctive in comparisons and
similes, or when they refer to events which occur repeatedly or
at an indefinite time, or when they refer to sayings which have a
general application.
